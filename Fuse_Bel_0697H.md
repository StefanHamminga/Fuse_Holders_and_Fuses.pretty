# Bel 0697H Series

Footprint verified with:
1. Datasheet: https://belfuse.com/resources/CircuitProtection/datasheets/0697H%20Mar2016.pdf
2. 3D model based on datasheet
3. Fitting of physical product in manufactured PCB

## Remarks and design choices

1. Current holes fit easily and position the part within margins. Reducing holes by ~ 0.05 to 0.1 would net a tight fit but might hinder quick assembly.
2. Rounded rectangles were chosen to allow easy hand soldering while keeping pad area to a minimum.
